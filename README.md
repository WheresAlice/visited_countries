# Alice's Visited Countries

This project is Alice's method of keeping track of which countries they have visited.  It is a single-page Jekyll website designed to be hosted on github-pages and edited using forestry.io.  It should work perfectly fine elsewhere though.

You should now be able to quite easily clone this and run it for yourself, editing _config.yml and _data/countries.yaml as appropriate.

## Usage:
- `bundle` to install dependencies
- `bundle exec jekyll --watch` to preview locally

You can either edit `_data/countries.yaml` locally or use forestry.io to maintain this.
